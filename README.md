# Audiobook Generator

Plan: Generate m4b from epub/fb2

Current: generate aac and mb4 from epub with chapter and images

Next step: add UI and configurability

Posible improvements: 
* remove the need of installing dependencies
* more language support

Requires ffmpeg to be isntalled for now, this could be done by running `winget install ffmpeg`

Also using playwright that requires installing step, may need to improve later.
For converting from wav to mb4 following tool could be used https://github.com/yermak/AudioBookConverter/releases
